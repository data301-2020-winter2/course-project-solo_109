# Solo Group 109 - GPU Compute Power Over Time

- Your title can change over time.

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The dataset I chose contains specs of ~3.3k Graphics Cards (GPUs) developed by **AMD** & **NVIDIA**. 
Computer technology has been a passion of mine as far as I can remember. One thing that amazed me as I was growing up was the blazing speed that graphics in
video games was improving at. Things such as soft shadows, more complex geometry (polygons to much denser shapes), realistic lighting/shaders, etc, all changed 
the gaming industry. CGI also benefitted hugely from the massive amount of compute power that each generation of GPUs brought. Recently, the enabling of RTX (Ray-Tracing)
on NVIDIA GPUs (1000 series and above) was a massive breakthrough. Ray-Tracing has existed for a long time, but being able to actually use it in realtime was a farfetched idea.
Advancements like this keep me excited to see what the future can offer in terms of computer technology. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

As mentioned previously, my dataset contains the specs of various GPUs. Specs such as Memory Speed, Memory Bandwidth, Memory Size, Process (in nano-meters), Clock Speed,
Release Date and Release Price will all be used to gauge performance gains between years, and overall. There are a total of 34 specs including the specs I mentioned.
